title: Introduction
description: Tesser is a modular, high-performance quantitative trading framework written in Rust.
---

Tesser addresses the gap between rigid, retail-grade trading bots and expensive, proprietary institutional systems. It provides a flexible foundation for building sophisticated strategies that run reliably 24/7.

## Core Philosophy

1.  **Correctness over Convenience**: Financial software must be reliable. We use `rust_decimal` for all calculations, enforce strict state reconciliation, and use SQLite for durable persistence.
2.  **Modularity**: The core trading logic (`tesser-strategy`) knows nothing about the exchange (`tesser-bybit`). This allows you to swap execution backends (e.g., from Paper to Binance to Bybit) without rewriting strategies.
3.  **Observability**: Real-time metrics (Prometheus), structured logging (JSON), and alerting (Webhooks) are first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.
