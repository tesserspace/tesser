## Prerequisites

- **Rust Toolchain**: Install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

## Installation

Clone the repository and build the workspace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tesserspace/tesser.git
cd tesser
cargo build --release
```

## Running Your First Backtest

Tesser comes with sample data and strategies so you can verify your setup immediately.

Run the `SmaCross` strategy against the sample Bitcoin data:

```bash
cargo run -p tesser-cli -- \
    backtest run \
    --strategy-config examples/strategies/sma_cross.toml \
    --data examples/data/btcusdt_1m_sample.csv \
    --quantity 0.01
```

You should see a performance report printed to the console, including Total Return, Sharpe Ratio, and Max Drawdown.
