## Sources

- **Bybit/Binance Historical** – Use `tesser-cli data download` for candles or `tesser-cli data download-trades` for tick data. For Bybit, pass `--source bybit-public --partition-by-day --resume` to stream the public archive with automatic resume. For Binance, `--source binance-public --binance-market futures-um` (or `spot` / `futures-cm`) pulls and caches the daily ZIPs before normalizing them to Tesser ticks.
- **Custom Feeds** – Drop CSV/JSONL files under `data/` and point backtests to them via `--data`.

## Validation

```bash
cargo run -p tesser-cli -- data validate \
    --input data/btcusdt_1m_sample.csv
```

The validator detects:

- Missing candles or duplicated timestamps.
- Price spikes outside configurable tolerances.
- Volume gaps that usually signal exchange outages.

## Storage

- CSV is the default interchange format for candles and quick diagnostics.
- Tick downloads are written as Parquet using the exact schema produced by the flight recorder, so the backtester can consume them without conversion.

Keep raw downloads immutable and derive normalized datasets via scripts in `research/` so simulations remain reproducible.
